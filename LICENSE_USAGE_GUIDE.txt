================================================================================

LICENSE TYPE: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3 (AGPLv3)
Repository: LZ4_huffman_hardware
Owner: weslay-koo

================================================================================
                            WHAT YOU CAN DO
================================================================================

✓ ALLOWED:
──────────

1. Use the hardware design in your project (any purpose)
   └─ Commercial, research, personal projects all OK

2. Modify and improve the design
   └─ Change any Verilog code as needed
   └─ Optimize for your platform

3. Copy and distribute the source code
   └─ Give to friends, colleagues, publish online

4. Create derivative works
   └─ Port to ASIC, different FPGA, custom hardware


================================================================================
                            WHAT YOU MUST DO
================================================================================

⚠ REQUIREMENTS - You MUST comply with these:

1. SHARE YOUR CHANGES (if you distribute)
   ├─ If you modify and distribute the code → must release source code
   └─ Must be under AGPLv3 or compatible license

2. INCLUDE LICENSE & ATTRIBUTION
   ├─ Include original LICENSE file with your project
   ├─ Keep copyright notices and attribution intact
   └─ Document what you changed (prominently)

3. NETWORK SERVICE CLAUSE (This is AGPLv3 specific!)
   ├─ If you run this as a network service or online tool
   ├─ Must provide users access to the modified source code
   └─ This is the key difference from GPL

4. NO WARRANTY / NO LIABILITY

   ├─ Author provides NO guarantee it works
   └─ You cannot sue if something fails


================================================================================
                        IS THIS "OPEN HARDWARE"?
================================================================================

Technically: YES
──────────────

AGPLv3 qualifies as open-source hardware:
  ✓ Source code is available
  ✓ You can inspect and modify
  ✓ You can redistribute
  ✓ Free to use for any purpose

However, it's NOT the most permissive license:
  • More restrictive than MIT, Apache, BSD licenses
  • More complex than GPL (network service clause)
  • Requires sharing modifications


Common Open Hardware Licenses (for comparison):
──────────────────────────────────────────────

1. MIT License
   ├─ Most permissive
   ├─ You can do almost anything
   ├─ Few restrictions
   └─ Good for: Permissive projects

2. Apache 2.0
   ├─ Permissive with patent protection
   ├─ Can use in commercial software
   └─ Good for: Corporate projects

3. GPL v3
   ├─ Copyleft (share improvements)
   ├─ Less restrictive than AGPL
   └─ Good for: Desktop/desktop software

4. AGPL v3 (THIS REPO) ← ← ← YOU ARE HERE
   ├─ Copyleft + network clause
   ├─ Must share improvements
   ├─ If offered as service → must share source
   └─ Good for: Community-driven projects

5. Creative Commons (various)
   ├─ For documentation, not usually code
   └─ Less suitable for hardware


================================================================================
                        PRACTICAL SCENARIOS
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: "I want to use it internally in my company"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: ✓ ALLOWED
Requirements:
  ├─ Keep original license file
  ├─ Keep copyright notices
  ├─ Include attribution
  └─ No requirement to share modifications (internal use only)

Example: You port to ASIC for internal use → OK!


SCENARIO 2: "I want to improve it and share with friends"
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: ✓ ALLOWED (with conditions)
Requirements:
  ├─ Keep AGPLv3 license
  ├─ Document your changes
  ├─ Share source code with friends
  ├─ They get same rights as you
  └─ Include original copyright + your attribution

Example: "I fixed bug X and optimized Y" → must share source


SCENARIO 3: "I want to sell hardware with this design"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: ⚠ COMPLICATED (possible but careful)
Requirements:
  ├─ You CAN charge for hardware

Requirements:
  ├─ If users access service remotely
  ├─ You must let them download the source code
  ├─ Including all your modifications
  ├─ Keep it up-to-date with running version
  └─ This is the "Affero" part of AGPL

Example: "LZ4 Hardware-as-a-Service" → must provide source to users


SCENARIO 5: "I want to relicense under MIT or Apache"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: ✗ NOT ALLOWED
Why:
  ├─ You didn't write original code
  ├─ Original author chose AGPL
  ├─ You cannot change license unilaterally
  ├─ Only original copyright holder can do that

Workaround:
  └─ Contact original author @weslay-koo and ask for permission

================================================================================
                        HOW TO COMPLY PROPERLY
================================================================================

If you want to use this legally, here's a checklist:

FOR INTERNAL USE (simplest):
───────────────────────────

□ Copy the LICENSE file to your project
□ Keep all copyright headers in source files
□ Add attribution comment: "Based on LZ4_huffman_hardware by weslay-koo"
□ Document your modifications (in comments or README)
□ Do NOT distribute outside your company

Required files to keep:
  ├─ LICENSE (original AGPLv3 text)
  ├─ README.md (document your changes)
  └─ All .v files with copyright headers intact


FOR DISTRIBUTION (complex):
───────────────────────────

□ Keep LICENSE file (AGPLv3 full text)
□ Keep copyright headers in all files
□ Add file header to modified files:
    // Modified by: [Your name]
    // Date: [Date]
    // Changes: [Description of changes]

□ Create CHANGES.md or CHANGELOG.md:
    # Modifications
    
    - Original project: LZ4_huffman_hardware
    - Original author: weslay-koo
    - License: GNU Affero General Public License v3
    
    ## Your changes:
    - Ported to ASIC (5 Nov 2025)
    - Optimized hash multiplier (12 Nov 2025)
    - etc.

□ Host on GitHub/GitLab (or equivalent):
    ├─ Include LICENSE file
    ├─ Reference original repository
    └─ Allow others to fork/modify

□ If offering as service:
    ├─ Provide download link to source
    ├─ Keep it synchronized with running version
    └─ Make prominent: "Source code available here"


================================================================================
                        RECOMMENDED APPROACH
================================================================================

Given that this is GPLv3 (restrictive), I recommend:

FOR YOUR PROJECT:

1. Contact original author (@weslay-koo on GitHub)
   ├─ Ask to relicense under MIT or Apache 2.0
   ├─ Many projects are willing to dual-license
   └─ Then your project has more freedom

2. Or, embrace the AGPL
   ├─ Use it as-is (no relicensing needed)
   ├─ Plan to release your improvements as open-source
   ├─ Great for research/academic projects
   └─ Good for community engagement

3. Or, develop separately
   ├─ Don't use this design
   ├─ Create your own from scratch
   └─ Full IP ownership


================================================================================
                        QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF
================================================================================

Before using this design, answer these:

□ Will I distribute this? (sell, publish, share?)
  └─ YES → Must provide source code (AGPLv3 copyleft)
  └─ NO → Can keep proprietary (internal use only)

□ Will I modify it significantly?
  └─ YES → Need to document changes clearly
  └─ NO → Just include original license

□ Will I offer it as a service (online)?
  └─ YES → Must share source with users (AGPL network clause)
  └─ NO → Less strict requirements

□ Do I want to relicense under MIT/Apache?
  └─ YES → Must contact @weslay-koo for permission
  └─ NO → Just use AGPL as-is


================================================================================
                        CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✓ YES, this is open hardware

✓ YES, you can use it in your project

⚠ BUT, you must:
   1. Keep the license file
   2. Maintain attribution
   3. Share improvements if you distribute
   4. Provide source if offered as service

✓ BEST PRACTICE:
   1. Contact @weslay-koo to ask about dual-licensing
   2. Document your modifications clearly
   3. Plan to release improvements back to community
   4. This builds reputation and community goodwill
